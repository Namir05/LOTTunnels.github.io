Description: Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, used to connect local services to remote systems. It is commonly used for bypassing firewalls, performing network tunneling, or establishing persistent access during penetration testing. Chisel can create both reverse and forward tunnels for redirecting traffic between different network environments. It is cross-platform and can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
